Collection of useful classes for your .NET application.


Library contains a number of reuseful base classes:

1. [Object pools](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/Object-pool) - easy to use object pools;
2. [Asynchronous data processing with queue](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/QueueAsyncProcessor) - help in parallelization of item processing;
3. [Thread pools](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/Thread-Pool) - fast thread pools with dynamic adjustment of thread count;
4. [Thread set manager](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/ThreadSetManager) - simplify common thread start/stop scenarios;
5. [SemaphoreLight](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/SemaphoreLight) - extremely fast lightweight semaphore;
6. [BlockingQueue](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/BlockingQueue) - thread safe queue with blocking (up to 5 times faster than BlockingCollection); 
7. [EntryCountingEvent](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/EntryCountingEvent) - allow to control the clients entered some block of code;
8. [ThrottlingBehaviour](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/ThrottlingBehaviour) - allow to limit the maximum requests per second;
9. [IoC container](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/IoC) - simple inversion-of-control container;
10. [WeakDelegate, WeakEvent](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/WeakEvent) - event with weak reference to subscribers;
11. [Deque](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/Deque) - collection of elements organized as deque;
12. [Priority Queues](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/Priority-Queues) - simple queue with limited number of priorities;
13. [Read only collections](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/Read-only-collections) - a number of useful readonly collections (List, Dictionary, HashSet);
14. [A bunch of extension methods](https://github.com/qoollo/system-class-library/wiki/Extension-Methods) for IEnumerable, Type, Exception.
